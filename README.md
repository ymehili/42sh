# 42sh 🚀
Welcome to 42sh, a Unix shell project. This project is a part of the curriculum at Epitech school. It's a great way to understand the inner workings of a shell.

## Features 🎁
Built-in commands: cd, echo, exit, setenv, unsetenv, env, history, alias, and more.

Command execution with their parameters.

Redirections and pipes.

Logical operators && and ||.

Background tasks with &.

Job control with fg, bg, and jobs.

Command history.

Variable substitution.

Backticks support.

## Building 🛠️
To build the project, use the provided Makefile:
```
make
```
This will create the 42sh executable.

## Testing 🧪
We have a batch tester to help ensure the shell behaves as expected. To use it, ensure you have the ```tester.sh``` script and the tests file in the ```tester/``` directory. Then, run:
```
./tester.sh
```
You can also run a specific test by providing the test number as an argument:
```
./tester.sh 42
```
For more details, check out the tester README.
